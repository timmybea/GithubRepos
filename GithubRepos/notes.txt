1. Create a new NSURL object from the flickr api url string.
2. Create a new NSURLRequest object using the URL object. Use this object to make configurations specific to the URL. For example, speicifying if this is a GET or POST request, or how we should cache data.
3. An NSURLSessionConfiguration object defines the behavior and policies to use when making a request with an NSURLSession object. We can set things like the caching policy on this object, similar to the NSURLRequest object, but we can use the session configuration to create many different requests, where any configurations we make to the NSURLRequest object will only apply to that single request. The default system values are good for now, so we'll just grab the default configuration.
4. Create an NSURLSession object using our session configuration. Any changes we want to make to our configuration object must be done before this.
5. We create a task that will actually get the data from the server. The session creates and configures the task and the task makes the request. Data tasks send and receive data using NSData objects. Data tasks are intended for short, often interactive requests to a server. Check out the NSURLSession API Referece for more info on this. We could optionally use a delegate to get notified when the request has completed, but we're going to use a completion block instead. This block will get called when the network request is complete, weather it was successful or not.







12. A task is created in a suspended state, so we need to resume it. We can also You can also suspend, resume and cancel tasks whenever we want. This can be incredibly useful when downloading larger files using a download task.
